### 3. [Where Am I](https://github.com/joeyzhong90595/Robotics-Software-Engineer-Projects/tree/master/P3-Where-Am-I)

A two-wheel robot is built with laser and camera set up. The robot tried to localize itself in the apartment with Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) algorithm, also known as particle filter.
